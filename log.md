### Day 2: 04/01/2017

**Thoughts:** Will have to redo later to improve the quality and fix the little bugs.

### Day 4: 06/01/2017

**Thoughts:** It can be stressful enough not to use custom style css.

### Day 5: 07/01/2017

**Thoughts:** Still did not understand why I coded it.

**Thoughts:** Was easier, but still had to try some varients.

### Day 7: 09/01/2017

**Thoughts:** BooHoo was too much simpler.

### Day 8: 10/01/2017

**Thoughts:** I am irritated that I did not do FCC, the FCC streak broke -_- ... 

### Day 9: 11/01/2017

**Thoughts:** Have to revise.

### Day 10: 12/01/2017

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 11: 13/01/2017

**Today's Progress**: Did "Sorted Union"

**Thoughts:** Going very slowly, must progress faster.

### Day 12: 14/01/2017

**Today's Progress**: Did NOT progress much, was trying to do "Smallest Common"

**Thoughts:** Distraction is dangerous.

### Day 13: 15/01/2017

**Today's Progress**: Did "Everything Be True", "Arguments Optional"

**Thoughts:** It took me a while to use !variable instead of all those NaN, Undefined and other checks, sadly, it was not re-usable.


### Day 14: 16/01/2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried Smallest Common challenge and failed to complete again.

**Thoughts:** It's taking time.
